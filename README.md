# Logic2 - Programming Laboratory

This repository contains the materials, exercises, and projects from the **Programming Laboratory** subject, taught by Ricardo Agostinho in 2025, for 2nd year students at IFSP.

## About the Subject

In this subject, we are exploring the Python programming language with a focus on web applications. We use Python together with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build dynamic web pages.

The web framework **Flask** (which uses the templating engine **Jinja2**) is our main tool for developing backend applications. This allows us to build server-side logic, manage routes, and render HTML templates dynamically.

Through this subject, we are developing our backend skills, learning how to create functional, responsive, and interactive web applications.
